My husband and I really enjoy eating lobster tails, but since they are generally pretty expensive we tend to save it for special occasions. However, our local fishmonger occasionally gets some fresh lobster tails in and is able to sell them for a pretty good price. My husband wants to go in the next time they’re on sale and buy a large batch to freeze so we can always have them on hand for when we want them. I don’t know if it’s possible to freeze lobster tails without ruining them. Even on sale they are far too expensive to just see them go to waste. So, before we buy a batch, I want to be sure! Can you freeze lobster tails?

Your dad sounds like a great guy, and his sauce must be amazing! The good news is that you can freeze homemade spaghetti sauce, so go ahead and take him up on his offer. Also, it doesn’t matter if the sauce is vegetarian or a meat sauce, it freezes just the same. The important thing is to protect it from freezer burn.

To freeze homemade spaghetti sauce, first allow the sauce to cool completely. This is very important, because it protects it from freezer burn and also helps avoid excess expansion of the freezer bag, which could lead to leaks. Once your sauce has cooled completely, it’s ready to be frozen. You could freeze the sauce in hard sided containers, but if you are planning on freezing a large batch, freezer bags take up less space as they can be stacked flat.
Stand a freezer bag in a bowl and fold the top over the rim. This will help keep the bag in place. Ladle in the desired amount of sauce. I suggest measuring the sauce into serving sizes, so you don’t end up thawing too much sauce when you make pasta. You don’t want any of it to go to waste! Leave about one to two inches of headroom at the top of the bag for expansion and then seal the bag. Label and date it, and then store it in the freezer lying flat. Continue the process until all the sauce is in bags.
To use frozen sauce, place a bag of sauce in the refrigerator to thaw. Then, pour the contents into a saucepan on the stove and gently reheat. Pour over your favourite pasta and enjoy. Unused sauce can be kept in the refrigerator for a few days.
