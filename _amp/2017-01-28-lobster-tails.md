##Pregunta

My husband and I really enjoy eating lobster tails, but since they are generally pretty expensive we tend to save it for special occasions. However, our local fishmonger occasionally gets some fresh lobster tails in and is able to sell them for a pretty good price. My husband wants to go in the next time they’re on sale and buy a large batch to freeze so we can always have them on hand for when we want them. I don’t know if it’s possible to freeze lobster tails without ruining them. Even on sale they are far too expensive to just see them go to waste. So, before we buy a batch, I want to be sure! Can you freeze lobster tails?

##Respuesta

 
 Yes, you can freeze lobster tails! Buying in bulk when they’re on sale and then freezing them for later is a great idea and a perfect way to save money! I will say that you must make sure that they are as fresh as possible, and that you have to keep them chilled before freezing them so that they don’t grow any harmful bacteria. 
To freeze lobster tails, they should first be blanched in a brine of about ½ cup non-iodized salt dissolved in 2 quarts of water, according to the Maine Lobster Marketing Cooperative. Bring the water to a rolling boil, and then place the lobster tails in the water for 60 seconds. Remove from the water with a slotted spoon and then chill in a mixture of 50% cold water and 50% ice to stop the cooking process. Allow the meat to completely cool by letting it sit in the cold water for 15-20 minutes. 
Remove the lobster tails from the cold water and ice mixture and dry thoroughly. Then, place the lobster tails in freezer safe bags. Remove the excess air, then seal the bags. Label and date the bags. Then, place each freezer bag inside another freezer bag and seal it, providing a double layer of protection. Place the bags in the coldest part of the freezer. Properly stored frozen lobster tails will last between 9-12 months in the freezer. To thaw, allow the lobster tails to thaw in the refrigerator overnight before cooking. Cook lobster tails in a 2% brine, the same ratio of salt to water as what you used to blanch the lobster in the first place.
