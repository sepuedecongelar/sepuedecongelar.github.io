## Pregunta

 My kids are pomegranate fanatics, and like to eat them for breakfast, dessert, or on their salads as often as they can. Unfortunately, most of the year pomegranates are very expensive, so I buy them sparingly. For a few months though, they are in season and they can be bought at a great price. I have always wondered if it would be possible for me to stock up on pomegranates when they are in season and then freeze them so that I have a supply to hold us over when they are expensive. I’m not sure if I could freeze them whole, or if I would have to remove the seeds first and then just freeze the seeds. Can you freeze pomegranates?

## Respuesta

 Yes, you can freeze pomegranates. You can actually freeze pomegranates whole, but as they take up quite a bit of space in the freezer if frozen whole, I recommend seeding the pomegranates before freezing. Yes, it takes a bit of work and more time to freeze seed the pomegranates first, but I think it’s worth it in the long run to save you freezer space and energy down the line. Frozen pomegranate seeds can be used from frozen, whereas frozen whole pomegranates must be thawed first and then seeded. 
To seed pomegranates without making a huge mess on your hands, consider seeding them underwater. Fill a large bowl with lukewarm water. Cut the pomegranate into quarters. Working one quarter at a time, place the pomegranate under water and push out the seeds. Remove the white pith from around them and then scoop the seeds out with a slotted spoon. Dry the seeds on some paper towels. Continue with the remaining sections. 
Place the seeds in a single layer on a baking sheet and place the sheet in the freezer for about fifteen minutes to flash freeze the seeds and stop them from sticking together in the freezer. Then, scoop the seeds into a freezer bag or hard sided freezer safe container. If using freezer bags, gently squeeze out the excess air. Seal the bag or container, then label and date it. Place it in the freezer until you need it. 
You can use frozen pomegranate seeds directly from the freezer, or allow them to thaw first. Keep any unused thawed seeds in the refrigerator and use within a few days of thawing.
