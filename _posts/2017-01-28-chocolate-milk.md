## Pregunta

 My daughter bought a big container of chocolate milk that only she is going to drink. No one else in the house likes it, and I don’t want her drinking the whole container on her own in a week. I don’t want to throw the excess out, but I’m not sure what else to do with it. I was wondering if I could take about half the container and freeze the contents for later, leaving half for my daughter to drink now. I’ve never tried freezing chocolate milk before, so I’m not sure if it’s a good idea. Can you freeze chocolate milk?

## Respuesta

 Yes, you can freeze chocolate milk. It’s similar to freezing regular milk, only it’s chocolate! You may find that some of the colouring separates upon freezing, but that can be fixed once the milk is thawed. It’s a great idea to freeze half for later and leave half for now. Milk taste and quality won’t be affected by freezing, although it may seem a bit more watery after thawing. 
To freeze chocolate milk, make sure that it is as fresh as possible. Avoid freezing milk that is past its best before date. Find a freezer safe container or use a freezer bag to store the milk in. Chocolate milk will expand upon freezing due to the water content, so leave some headroom to allow for expansion. Before filling the container, give the chocolate milk a stir or a good shake to mix up the chocolate colouring and the sugar. Then, fill the container, leaving about two inches at the top. Seal the container, then label and date it. Place the chocolate milk in the coldest part of the freezer. 
To thaw frozen chocolate milk, remove it from the freezer. Thaw the chocolate milk in the fridge for several hours or overnight. Do not thaw frozen chocolate milk on the counter, as bacteria can begin to grow at room temperature. When the milk is thawed completely, you may notice that it has separated or that it has a thin texture. Give the chocolate milk a shake or a good stir, and then consume as usual. Store any unused, thawed chocolate milk in the refrigerator. Do not refreeze previously frozen chocolate milk. Consume thawed chocolate milk within a few days for best results, and consume frozen chocolate milk within six months of freezing.
