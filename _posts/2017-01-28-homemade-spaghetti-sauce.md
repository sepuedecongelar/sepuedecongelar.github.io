##Pregunta

My dad makes the best spaghetti sauce in the world, and I always insist he makes me some when I go to visit. He likes to cook, and even though he’s given me the recipe, it just doesn’t taste the same when I make it. He has the magic touch! Unfortunately, even though I bring home a huge pot of sauce each time I see him, I’m always left craving more sauce between visits. He has offered to make me a few batches that I can take home and put in the deep freezer for when I need it, but I’m afraid it won’t taste the same after thawing. Can you freeze homemade spaghetti sauce?

##Respuesta

 Your dad sounds like a great guy, and his sauce must be amazing! The good news is that you can freeze homemade spaghetti sauce, so go ahead and take him up on his offer. Also, it doesn’t matter if the sauce is vegetarian or a meat sauce, it freezes just the same. The important thing is to protect it from freezer burn.

To freeze homemade spaghetti sauce, first allow the sauce to cool completely. This is very important, because it protects it from freezer burn and also helps avoid excess expansion of the freezer bag, which could lead to leaks. Once your sauce has cooled completely, it’s ready to be frozen. You could freeze the sauce in hard sided containers, but if you are planning on freezing a large batch, freezer bags take up less space as they can be stacked flat. 
Stand a freezer bag in a bowl and fold the top over the rim. This will help keep the bag in place. Ladle in the desired amount of sauce. I suggest measuring the sauce into serving sizes, so you don’t end up thawing too much sauce when you make pasta. You don’t want any of it to go to waste! Leave about one to two inches of headroom at the top of the bag for expansion and then seal the bag. Label and date it, and then store it in the freezer lying flat. Continue the process until all the sauce is in bags. 
To use frozen sauce, place a bag of sauce in the refrigerator to thaw. Then, pour the contents into a saucepan on the stove and gently reheat. Pour over your favourite pasta and enjoy. Unused sauce can be kept in the refrigerator for a few days.
